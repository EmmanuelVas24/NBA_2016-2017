# NBA_2016-2017

In this project, I will be analyzing the shot logs of a few NBA teams over the course of the 2016-2017 season. So far, I've analyzed the Lakers and Brandon Ingram's rookie campaign. I created a classification model to predict the shot success of Brandon Ingram. 
I'll do James Harden and the Houston Rockets next.
